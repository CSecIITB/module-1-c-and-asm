# Assembly, but limited memory!

One of these other days we came across a 64-bit device on which anything consuming too much memory would just blow up! For some reason, @Owl-A wanted this device to compute Fibonacci numbers and due to the limited memory, he had to program directly in Assembly. Good people write good codes and thus, [Owl-A's%20script](src/fib.S) is not working. 

Someone informed him that memory was the source of all his troubles but he, being occupied with other things, has now left it to you to figure out how to make things work! He mentioned something of the likes of [Tail Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) before leaving but we are not sure how this would help...

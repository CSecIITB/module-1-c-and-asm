Here are instructions on how to run the challenges.

You are given two challenges each consisting of 5 levels.
The two challenges are in the files `chall_1.py` & `chall_2.py` and for running them you need to run the `broiler_ 1.py` & `broiler_2.py` respectively.

You have to mention the level in broiler code at line 9 (initially set to 1) and then write your assembly code at the specified place.
On running the broiler file using `python3 broiler_1.py` or `python broiler_1.py`, you could see the task you need to perform in that level 
also this would evaluate the assembly code which you wrote earlier. 

Each level makes you familiar with various functionalities of x86 asm programming.

## Submission Instruction
You need to create 10 text files of the format `asm_{chall}_{level}.txt`, where chall ∈ [1,2] and level ∈ [1,5]. Save these text files inside a directory named `submission`.

Each text file should contain the assembly code, which works for that particular level.
